Write a program that reads the subtotal and the
gratuity rate, then computes the gratuity and total. For example, if the user enters 10
for subtotal and 15% for gratuity rate, the program displays $1.5 as gratuity and $11.5
as total. Here is a sample run:
Enter subtotal and gratuity rate : 10 15
The gratuity is $1.5 and total is $11.5

CODE:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Q3 {
public static void main(String[] args) {

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print(&quot;Enter your subtotal and the gratuity rate: &quot;);
double subtotal = sc.nextDouble();
double percentgrat = sc.nextDouble();
double gratuity = subtotal * (percentgrat / 100);
double total = subtotal + gratuity;

System.out.printf(&quot;The gratuity is: $%.2f and the total including gratuity is: $&quot; + total, gratuity);
}

}
